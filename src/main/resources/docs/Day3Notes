Microservices

* Individual scalable components, deployable without service interruptions
* Failure redirection
* Apigee API management (Provides proxies and redirects to actual service provides authentication, mediation and callouts in the process)
* breakdown bus logic into separate containers(different service calls running in different environments)
* calls API gateway and then routes into necessary API
* managed runtime environment directly on OS without installing a application on app server 

Principles

* Single responsibility
* Built around a specific business logic
* Independently deployable 
* Never Fail system with zero fault tolerance
